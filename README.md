# Goal_e 

This repository is for my capstone project in the [MS Software Development program](https://online.maryville.edu/online-masters-degrees/software-development/) at [Maryville University](https://online.maryville.edu/why-maryville/).

## Overview

Goal_e, or Goal-e, is a web application that allows users to set and track goals.

Goal_e includes a points system for completed goals and the ability to prioritize goals. Goal_e includes the ability to set the current progress towards goals, as well as the ability to set deadlines for goals. Goal_e visualizes current goals, the progress towards those goals, and previously completed goals. Goal_e also includes calendar views that display monthly and daily information about set goals.

All the code for Goal_e can be found in this repository. I built Goal_e using the [Django framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/). 

## Design

Documents related to the design of Goal_e, including Goal_e's user interface, database, and service layer can be found in the [design folder](design).

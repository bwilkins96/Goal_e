# Goal_e

This repository is for my capstone project in the [MS Software Development program](https://online.maryville.edu/online-masters-degrees/software-development/) at [Maryville University](https://online.maryville.edu/why-maryville/).

## Overview

Goal_e will be a web application that allows users to set and track goals. Goal-e will include a points system for completed goals and the ability to prioritize goals. Goal-e will also include the ability to set the current progress towards goals, as well as the ability to set deadlines for goals. Goal-e will visualize current goals, progress towards those goals, and previous goals.

I plan on keeping all the code for Goal_e in this repository, including code for the user interface and service layer. I will build Goal_e using the [Django framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/). 

I will update this README as I work on the project.

## Design

Documents related to the design of Goal_e, including Goal_e's user interface, database, and service layer can be found in the [design folder](design).
